# MLa2

When the semester is finished, it will be chanegd to a private one.

Data
Part I
The problem is generated by the api provided by mlrose.
Part II
The dataset can be downloaded the repository on Github or from the source at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#

Code
All the experiments are conducted with Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
ML_A2.ipynb includes all of the main experiments in part I & II.
You can run the codes block by block to get my results and it shows my logic about data preparation and parameter-tuning clearly. 
Please make sure that all the python libs required are prepared.
Please pay attention to the problem B in part I. The current definition of edges generates the graph shown in Figure 4 (right). You can generate the graph on the left by erasing the last element of the given list.
The only one place that you need to edit is the root for data because I load it with absolute root on my laptop.

If you come up with any problems, feel free to contact me at ygao467@gatech.edu
